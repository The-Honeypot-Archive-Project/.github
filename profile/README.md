# The Honeypot Archive Project

The **mission** of The Honeypot Archive Project (THAP) is to help preserve honeypot software.

## Activities

The work of preserving honeypots software is extensive. There are currently two main activities:

1. The Honeypot Dataset: a structured list of honeypots software that allows quickly searches.
2. Honeypot Adoption: un-maintained honeypots are adopted, fixed, and preserved - often by creating docker images - to give them LTS.


## Founders

This project was originally founded by Veronica Valeros, a security researcher at the Stratosphere Research Laboratory, AIC, FEL, Czech Technical University in Prague
